# prisoner

This is a Prisoner's Dilemma simulation written in Clojure.

I've selected the payoffs and names based on
Richard Dawkins' description in The Selfish Gene.

The plan will be to develop a few different tournament types
starting with a simple, random number of rounds and ending 
with an evolutionary tournament where strategies are paid
with offspring.

The goal of this project is to learn both Clojure and some
basic evolutionary/genetic programming techniques while
having fun.


## TODO

- Write some tests
- Build the language up to the problem
- Create the game and round abstractions
- Create a reporting function that produces final results
